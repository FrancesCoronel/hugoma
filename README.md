A starter theme for Hugo created with Bulma and optimized with modern workflows and tooling. 🌟️

**THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT OFFICIALLY PUBLISHED AS A THEME YET.**

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

### Start Live Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically open a browser tab with the website and BrowserSync will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

### Build

To build a static version of the website inside the `/dist` folder

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

This website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as the static site generator and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) + [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as the asset pipeline.

It is set up to use [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Sass and JavaScript compilation and transpilation.
