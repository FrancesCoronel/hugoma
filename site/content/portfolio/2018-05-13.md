I was thinking to myself, why not create a Hugo theme?

I mean, I LOVE Hugo. I just love it. Before this, I used Wordpress for about 4 years and tried Jekyll out.

That was a truly horrendous experience. Working on original content became more and more of a burden and hassel with Jekyll customizations/templating/etc which is exactly what I was trying to avoid in the first place.

I just wanted the power to design my own little corner in the web.

"To be able to share my obsessions and oddities shouldn't have to be such a hassle", I figured.

I mean, shouldn't everyone ought to know how cute my dog is through my rantings?

> What a cutie!
